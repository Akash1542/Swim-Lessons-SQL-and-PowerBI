Description:
This project involved designing and implementing a relational database system to manage swim lesson programs effectively. The system focuses on organizing lesson plans, tracking participant progress, and ensuring data security.
Additionally, a Power BI dashboard was developed to visualize key performance metrics related to swim lessons.

Contents:
- Create_SwimLessons_Tables.sql: SQL script to create necessary tables for the Swim Lessons database.
- Insert_SwimLessons_Data.sql: SQL script to insert sample data into the tables.
- Swim_Lessons_Dashboard.pbix: Power BI dashboard file for data visualization and analysis.
- ER_Diagram_SwimLessons.png: Entity-Relationship diagram representing the database structure.

Software Requirements:
- MySQL Workbench 8.0 or compatible SQL database client
- Power BI Desktop (latest version recommended)

How to Open/Review:
- Open `Create_SwimLessons_Tables.sql` and execute it in MySQL Workbench to create the database schema.
- Run `Insert_SwimLessons_Data.sql` to populate the database with sample data.
- Open `Swim_Lessons_Dashboard.pbix` using Power BI Desktop to interact with the swim lessons dashboard.
- View `ER_Diagram_SwimLessons.png` for an overview of the database design.

Notes:
- Ensure a MySQL server instance is running to execute the SQL scripts.
- Power BI Desktop must be installed to view or modify the dashboard file.
